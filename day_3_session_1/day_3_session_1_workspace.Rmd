## What is the workspace?
- The workspace holds all data, functions, and objects created in a specific R session
- Can be saved as a `.Rdata` file upon quitting R
- Can be loaded at the start of a new R session

## Managing the workspace
Function | Purpose
|---|---|
`getwd()` | print the current working directory
`ls()` | list the objects in the current workspace
`setwd(mydir)` | change working directory to `mydir`
`history()` | display the last 25 commands used in the console


## Managing the workspace
Function | Purpose
|---|---|
`savehistory(file = "myfile")` | save command history to file `"myfile"` in the current working directory
`loadhistory(file = "myfile")` | load previous history
`save.image()` | save workspace to a `.Rdata` file
`q()` | quit R

## Saving and loading the workspace
- RStudio should ask to save the workspace when you exit the program
- Whether to save or not depends on how large your files are
- Also depends on whether you need all of your objects
- Can get around this by using scripts, and saving individual objects

## Saving and loading data
- Smaller file size than saving the entire workspace
- Faster to both save and load
- Save: `save(myobj, file = "myobjfile")`
- Load: `load(file = "myobjfile")`

## Projects
- RStudio opens in a default "project"
- Organize work on specific projects/assignments/tasks using projects
- To create a new project:
    - Go to "File", "New Project"
    - Choose where to place the project. "New working directory" creates a new folder, "Existing working directory" places the object in an existing folder, "Version control" allows you to use git/Github
    - Name the project
- Projects save some aspects of the workspace by default, like which scripts are open
- Automatically associated with a specific working directory

## Running scripts
- Scripts help to organize commands
- You can also write programs in scripts
- Two options to run a script:
    1. Click "Source" when the script is open
    2. Run `source("myscript")` from the console or another script
    
## Summary
- The workspace holds all objects and functions for a given session
- Projects each have their own workspace, and can help to organize different tasks
- Scripts help organize commands for specific tasks
